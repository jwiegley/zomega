# A more extensible solver for Z equations

This is the very start (not working yet) of a solver similar to ring/omega
which is intended to allow extending for specialized domain.  In particular,
it began as a way for Benoit Viguier to speed up some of the proofs of his
cryptography work involved the Verified Software Toolchain.
